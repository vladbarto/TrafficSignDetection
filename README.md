## Authors

## Starting problem
![client_req](./Media/client_requirements.PNG)

	Being given colour images featuring circular, triangular or rectangular traffic signs, 
	a method of detection of all traffic signs from these images will be studied and implemented.

	As a result, detected traffic signs (or areas of those) will be marked over original images 
	of traffic scenes.
